## Form Validation Form  

This is the first exercise for Brad Traversy's 20 Web Projects with Vanilla JS. 

We will be doing a for validation. 

This form will be first created with HTML,CSS, and JavaScript, 

Then it will be refractored to check each validation. 

Such as require, length, or if the passwords match. 

Every field is required, each field will have a min-max length.
